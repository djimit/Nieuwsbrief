              "            <p>NVIDIA 今天推出了一項人工智慧代工服務（AI foundry service），旨在為部署在 Microsoft Azure 上的企業和新創公司增強客製化生成式人工智慧應用程式的開發和調整。NVIDIA 人工智慧代工服務匯集了三個要素：一系列的 NVIDIA AI Foundation Models、NVIDIA NeMo™ 框架和工具以及 NVIDIA DGX™ Cloud 人工智慧超級運算服務，這為企業提供了一個端到端的解決方案，用於創建自定義生成式人工智慧模型。然後，企業可以使用 NVIDIA AI Enterprise 軟體部署客製化的模型，以驅動生成式人工智慧應用程式，包括智慧搜尋、摘要和內容生成。業界領導者 SAP SE、Amdocs 和 Getty Images 是率先使用此服務建立客製化模型的先驅。NVIDIA 創辦人暨執行長黃仁勳表示：「企業需要客製化模型，來執行根據公司專有 DNA（即資料）訓練的專業技能。NVIDIA 的人工智慧代工服務結合了我們的生成式人工智慧模型技術、大型語言模型訓練的專業知識和巨型人工智慧工廠。 我們在 Microsoft Azure 中建立了此功能，以便世界各地的企業可以將其客製化的模型與微軟世界領先的雲端服務連接起來。」微軟董事長暨執行長 Satya Nadella 表示：「我們與 NVIDIA 的合作涵蓋了 Copilot 堆疊的每一層 – 從晶片到軟體 – 我們共同為這個人工智慧新時代進行創新，憑藉在 Microsoft Azure 上的 NVIDIA 生成式人工智慧代工服務，我們為企業和新創公司提供在我們雲上構建和部署人工智慧應用程式的新能力。」業界領導者打造量身訂製、及時的大型語言模型NVIDIA 人工智慧代工服務可用於為各產業客製化生成式人工智慧驅動應用程式的模型，包括企業軟體、電信和媒體。一旦準備好部署，企業可以使用一種稱為檢索增強生成（RAG）的技術，將其模型與企業資料相連接，並獲取新洞察。作為 Microsoft Azure 上 NVIDIA DGX Cloud 的第一個客戶，SAP 計劃使用 NVIDIA 人工智慧代工服務和最佳化的 RAG 工作流程，搭配在 Azure 上運行的 NVIDIA DGX Cloud 和NVIDIA AI Enterprise 軟體，來客製化並部署其新的自然語言生成式人工智慧助手 Joule®。SAP SE 執行長暨執行董事會成員 Christian Klein 表示：「Joule 充分發揮了 SAP 在商業和技術結合方面的獨特地位，並建立在我們相關、可靠和負責任的商業人工智慧方法的基礎上。與 NVIDIA 的合作，Joule 可以透過自動化耗時的任務，快速分析資料，提供更智慧、個人化的體驗，協助客戶釋放生成式人工智慧在他們業務中的潛力。」Amdocs 是一家為通訊和媒體公司提供軟體和服務的領先供應商，正在最佳化 Amdocs amAIz 框架的模型，以加快全球電信公司採用生成式人工智慧應用程式和服務。Amdocs 總裁暨執行長 Shuky Sheffer 表示：「生成式人工智慧技術為電信服務供應商重塑與客戶互動的方式提供了絕佳的機會。利用 NVIDIA 和微軟的技術為 Amdocs amAlz 框架提供動力，將更快地為客戶帶來由生成式人工智慧驅動的新應用程式，使他們能夠從生成式人工智慧的巨大潛力中受益，同時還提供他們企業級的安全性、可靠性和性能。」.\n",
              "為客製化生成式人工智慧精選、最佳化的模型使用 NVIDIA 代工服務的客戶可以從多個 NVIDIA AI Foundation 模式中進行選擇，其中包含託管在 Azure 人工智慧模型目錄中的全新 NVIDIA Nemotron-3 8B 模型系列。 開發者還可以在 NVIDIA NGC™ 目錄中存取 Nemotron-3 8B 模型以及像是為了 NVIDIA 加速運算最佳化後的 Meta 的 Llama 2 社群模型，也即將可於 Azure 人工智慧模型目錄中獲得。Nemotron-3 8B 系列經過 80 億個參數的最佳化，包括針對不同用例進行調整的版本，並具有用於建立客製化企業生成式人工智慧應用程式的多語言功能。NVIDIA DGX Cloud 現已在微軟 Azure Marketplace 上提供NVIDIA DGX Cloud AI 超級運算現已在 Azure Marketplace 上提供。它提供了客戶可以租用的執行個體，可擴展至數千個 NVIDIA Tensor 核心 GPU，並附帶 NVIDIA AI Enterprise 軟體，包括 NeMo，以加速大型語言模型的客製化。在 Azure Marketplace 上新增 DGX Cloud 使 Azure 客戶能夠使用現有的微軟 Azure 使用量承諾（MACC），以利用 NVIDIA AI 超級運算和軟體來加速模型開發。NVIDIA AI Enterprise 軟體現已整合到 Azure Machine Learning 中，加入了 NVIDIA 的安全、穩定且受支援的人工智慧和資料科學軟體平台。這將使 NeMo 和 NVIDIA Triton 推論伺服器帶入Azure的企業級人工智慧服務。NVIDIA AI Enterprise 也可在 Azure Marketplace 上獲得，為全球企業提供廣泛的選項，用於生產就緒的人工智慧開發和客製化生成式人工智慧應用程式的部署。</p>\n",
